
This directory contains source image test data and reference test data
referred to by ITU-T T.83 | ISO/IEC 10918-2, "Digital compression and 
coding of continuous-tone still images:  Compliance testing".  This 
data are used for compliance testing of proposed encoders and decoders.

A8.SRC
B8.SRC
C8.SRC
D8.SRC
        8-bit Source image test data
        8-bit lossless decoder reference data.
        
A16.SRC
B16.SRC
C16.SRC
D16.SRC
        16-bit lossless decoder reference data, constructed
        from the 8-bit data.

EREF_A8.DCT
EREF_B8.DCT
EREF_C8.DCT
EREF_D8.DCT
        8-bit Encoder reference test data (DCT-based processes).
        These files give the DCT coefficients for each 8-by-8 block
        from components A, B, C, D respectively, including blocks at
        the edges that were completed by extension.
        The coefficients are given as 16-bit integers in zig-zag order.
        
DREF_A8.DCT
DREF_B8.DCT
DREF_C8.DCT
DREF_D8.DCT
        8-bit Decoder reference test data (DCT-based processes).
        Same format as the encoder reference test data described above.
        
EREF_A12.DCT
EREF_B12.DCT
EREF_C12.DCT
EREF_D12.DCT
        12-bit Encoder reference test data (DCT-based processes).
        These files give the DCT coefficients for each 8-by-8 block
        from components A, B, C, D respectively, including blocks at
        the edges that were completed by extension.
        The coefficients are given as 16-bit integers in zig-zag order.
        
DREF_A12.DCT
DREF_B12.DCT
DREF_C12.DCT
DREF_D12.DCT
        12-bit Decoder reference test data (DCT-based processes).
        Same format as the encoder reference test data described above.
